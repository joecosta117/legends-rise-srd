        <h1>Armor</h1>
        <p>
          Armor helps defend you from incoming harm. All armor unless magical or
          made out of special material is item tier 1 and costs 1 gold. All
          armor takes 1 minute to take on or off, except for shields. You can
          remove or equip a shield with the interact maneuver.
        </p>
        <h2 className="header">Armor Training</h2>
        <p>
          Your class determines what armor you're trained in. If you arenâ€™t
          trained in armor while wearing armor, then your speed is halved and
          you're{" "}

          , except for mystic robes.
        </p>
        <h2 className="header">Armor Types</h2>
        <p>
          There are four types of armor. Each armor grants certain benefits
          while worn.
        </p>
        <h3 className="header">Mystic Robes</h3>
        <p>
          <i>
            Mystic robes don't protect from physical threats, but instead ward
            from mystical threats. Typically these are robes or garments covered
            with arcane sigils, blessed by the gods, or made out of eldritch
            material.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>Mystic robes grants +2 to Spirit.</p>
        <h3 className="header">Light Armor</h3>
        <p>
          <i>
            The least restrictive of armor, light armor is typically made of
            leather or strategic placings of plate or chainmail to only protect
            vital areas.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>Light armor grants +1 to Guard.</p>
        <h3 className="header">Heavy Armor</h3>
        <p>
          <i>
            Heavy armor is sturdier than light armor, offering the best
            protection. Heavy armor is typically created from plates of metal,
            chainmail, or other dense material.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>Heavy armor grants +2 to Guard.</p>
        <h3 className="header">Shields</h3>
        <p>
          <i>
            Shields are typically affixed to your arm to help protect you
            against incoming harm.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Shields grant +1 to Guard and can be used as a melee weapon, dealing 2
          physical damage.
