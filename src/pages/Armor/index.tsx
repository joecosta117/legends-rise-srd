        <h1>Armor</h1>
        <p>
          Armor helps defend you from incoming physical harm. All armor unless
          magical or made out of special material is item tier 1 and costs 1
          gold. All armor takes 1 minute to take on or off, except for shields.
          You can remove or wield a shield with the Interact maneuver.
        </p>
        <h2>Armor Training</h2>
        <p>
          Your class determines what armor you're trained in. If you arenâ€™t
          trained in armor while wearing armor, then your speed is halved and
          you're{" "}

        <h2>Armor Types</h2>
        <p>
          There are three types of armor. Each armor grants certain benefits
          while worn.
        </p>
        <h3 className="header">Light Armor</h3>
        <p>
          <i>
            The least restrictive of armor, light armor is typically made of
            leather or strategic placings of plate or chainmail to only protect
            vital areas.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>Light armor grants +2 to Evasion.</p>
        <h3 className="header">Heavy Armor</h3>
        <p>
          <i>
            Heavy armor is sturdier than light armor, offering the best
            protection. Heavy armor is typically created from plates of metal,
            chainmail, or other dense material.

          to physical damage equal to your tier.
        </p>
        <h3 className="header">Shields</h3>
        <p>
          <i>
            Shields are typically affixed to your arm to help protect you
            against incoming harm.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Shields grant +1 to Evasion and can be used as a melee weapon, dealing
          2 physical damage.
