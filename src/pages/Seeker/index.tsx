            <h1>Seeker</h1>
            <p>
              Seekers are mystical warriors who draw upon spirit and discipline
              to fight with supernatural precision. Ever striving for harmony
              within themselves and the world, they blur the line between the
              physical and the spiritual as they unleash strikes beyond mortal
              limits. Play a seeker if you want to channel inner power like a
              Jedi or wuxia hero, striking with afterimages, psychic energy, and
              essence-infused blows.
